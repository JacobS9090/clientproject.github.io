          <p class="info"> Charles always wanted to find something to do as a boy, so Charles and his brothers would always try and find the time to go fish whenever they could.
          Charles and his brothers are involved in one of the largest companies in the US but they wanted to pursue their passion for fishing as well. So he and his brothers used
          their capital to create the Coral Beach Fishing Academy.

            Before David's death, David was heavily involved in the creation of the Coral Beach Fishing Academy. David was the one who came up with the idea of finding the place to fish.
            His capital allowed him to expand and he always would be found surveying and making sure that all of the locations fit the standards of Coral Beach Fishing Academy.
